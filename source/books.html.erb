      Dr. Steiman's first book, <i>The Hawai&lsquo;i Coffee Book: A Gourmet's Guide from Kona to Kaua&lsquo;i</i> (2008), 
      explores coffee's journey from the farm to the brewed cup.  All the while, it uses the Hawaii
      coffee industry as a case study of that journey.  This is an easy to read book filled with
      something for the coffee-curious to the coffee professional.  This book is no longer in print.

      In 2013, Dr. Steiman teamed up with 2 colleagues to co-edit <i>Coffee: A Comprehensive Guide to the
        Bean, the Beverage, and the Industry</i> and author several chapters.  Each chapter in this book
      delves deep into a specific coffee topic, each written by different coffee expert.  Almost
      encyclopedic in its reach, this book is valuable to anyone eager to immerse themselves in
      coffee

      uncompromising and unapologetic</i> (2015), is written in a Q & A format.  Each chapter is posed as a question and each 
      question is answered using the most current information in the scientific literature.  There's something in this
